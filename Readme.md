# Enviroment Logger - ESP32 collector

A small and simple project to collect various data about CO2, pressure, temperature and humidity in a network of different devices, collecting on a simple server (in this case my Raspi in my home network) and display it on a website and for example various TFT-displays connected to the EPS32's.
